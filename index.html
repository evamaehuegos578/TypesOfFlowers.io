                        <p class="card-text"> are one of the most popular flower types and are best known for their dazzling yellow color and large size. Sunflowers generally symbolize adoration, loyalty and longevity in flower language. Native Americans view sunflowers as a symbol of harvest and bounty since the flower provides seeds and pigments on top of being visually beautiful. Sunflowers need direct sunlight for 6 to 8 hours per day and require hot conditions to flower well. Sunflowers also have long roots that require plenty of room to spread out, so soil should be well dug and not too dense for growth. Avoid over fertilization or risk your stems breaking in the fall.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">There are over 150 species of tulips with over 3,000 different varieties and are part of the lily family. Like most common flowers, tulips come in a large variety of colors that each have their own meaning. As a signal of the arrival of spring, these blooms are often associated with the Easter holiday. Tulips were at one point more valuable than gold in Holland during a period of “Tulip Mania” and their popularity has only spread with time! Tulip bulbs should be planted in the fall in areas where they can receive partial to full sun. Tulips will fare better in soil that allows for drainage since over watering will drown the bulb and roots.</p>
